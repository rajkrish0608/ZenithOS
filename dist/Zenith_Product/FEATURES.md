# What is Zenith? (Simple Explanation)

## 1. Do Not Disturb on Steroids
Most "Focus Modes" just stop notifications. Zenith actually **slows down** distracting apps (like games or social media) so they don't drain your battery or tempt you, while giving **more power** to your work apps (like VS Code or Word).

## 2. It Knows What You're Doing
You don't have to tell it "I'm working." If you open a coding tool, it knows you're coding. If you open a game, it knows you're gaming. It switches modes automatically.

## 3. Privacy Guaranteed
It runs 100% on your laptop. It doesn't send your data to Google, Apple, or us. It's your private assistant.

## 4. The "Pro" Experience
We added a "Pro" mode to show how it could be a real product. You can "upgrade" (for free, it's a simulation) to unlock deep focus tools.
